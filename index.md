Welcome to my research portal. I am an **Atmospheric Scientist** specializing in **Tropical Cyclones** and **Data Assimilation** at the University of Miami (CIMAS) and NOAA/AOML Hurricane Research Division.

My work focuses on enhancing the predictability of extreme weather systems through high-resolution data integration and the study of non-linear dynamical systems.
