# Welcome to the Logistic Map Explorer

This site serves as the interactive companion to my research in **Chaos and Predictability**. 

### Understanding the Logistic Map
The logistic map is a discrete-time demographic model often cited as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behavior can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations:

$$x_{i+1} = r x_i (1 - x_i)$$

### Interactive Simulator
I have developed a specialized simulator to explore these dynamics.
