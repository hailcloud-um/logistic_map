Welcome to my research portal. I am an **Atmospheric Scientist** specializing in **Tropical Cyclones** and **Data Assimilation** at the University of Miami (CIMAS) and NOAA/AOML Hurricane Research Division. 

My work focuses on enhancing the predictability of extreme weather systems through high-resolution data integration and the study of non-linear dynamical systems.

### Research Portfolios

* **[Logistic Map & Chaos](/logistic-map/)**: An interactive look at discrete-time demographic models and the transition to chaotic behavior.

* **Hurricane Data Projects**: Standardizing hurricane observation datasets from NOAA and Air Force Reserve instruments (Coming Soon).
