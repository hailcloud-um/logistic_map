This app demonstrates the chaotic behavior of dynamical models for the one-dimensional logistic equation, with the unique additional application of model error. It is developed and hosted by Altug Aksoy, who is jointly appointed at University of Miami/Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA/Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML). The app can be fully run at https://logistic-map.streamlit.app/.
