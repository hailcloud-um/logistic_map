# Logistic Map Simulator: Visualizing Chaos and Predictability Limits

This repository contains the source code for the **Logistic Map Simulator**, an interactive tool designed to explore **chaos theory**, **nonlinear dynamics**, and **predictability limits** in 1D dynamical systems.

### 🌐 [Launch the Live App on Streamlit](https://logistic-map.streamlit.app)

## Overview
Unlike standard simulators, this app demonstrates the chaotic behavior of the **one-dimensional logistic equation** with a specific focus on **model error** and **initial-condition uncertainty**. It allows researchers and students to visualize how uncertainty propagates in chaotic models, leading to a "predictability horizon."

### Key Features
* **Interactive Logistic Map**: Adjust the growth parameter ($r$) to observe bifurcation and the transition to chaos.
* **Predictability Analysis**: Model the impact of **Monte Carlo** simulations on system variability.
* **Chaos Visualization**: Direct application of research regarding how model biases affect long-term forecasts.

## Research & Citation
This tool was developed by **Dr. Altug Aksoy** (University of Miami / CIMAS & NOAA / AOML) as a companion to the following research:
